# Bamazon

The goal of the Bamazon app is to allow a user to request an item and quantity of that item from our online store. After the item and quantity are selected, the user is then notified of whether the item is in stock or not.

If it is in stock, the purchase is made and they are notified of the total. If not, they are told that the item isn't in stock.

## How it works
