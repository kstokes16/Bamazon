# Bamazon

The goal of the Bamazon app is to allow a user to request an item and quantity of that item from our online store. After the item and quantity are selected, the user is then notified of whether the item is in stock or not.

If it is in stock, the purchase is made and they are notified of the total. If not, they are told that the item isn't in stock.

## How it works

* A user selects the product they would like
* A user then selects what quantity they would like
* The MySQL database is checked to see if the item and quantity is in stock
* If them item is in stock, the user is notified it is in stock and notified of their total
* If their item isn't in stock, they are notified that the item is not in stock
